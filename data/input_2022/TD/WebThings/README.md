# WebThings Gateway

The Thing Descriptions contained in the TDs folder were generated by the latest master branch of [WebThings Gateway](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/), using the [Virtual Things Adapter](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/virtual-things-adapter/) which showcases all the different types of web things the gateway supports.

Around 100 other add-ons are available which bridge different IoT and smart home protocols to the Web of Things.

The Thing Descriptions generated by WebThings Gateway are now considered largely compliant with WoT Thing Description 1.1 and the HTTP Basic Profile and HTTP SSE Profile from WoT Profiles (please see the Profile implementation report for WebThings Gateway).

The gateway also exposes a Thing Directory at `/things`, but this is not yet fully compliant with the Directory Service API from the WoT Discovery specification and is not currently described by a Thing Description itself (please see the Discovery implementation report for WebThings Gateway).

For known W3C compliance issues, see https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aw3c-compliance
