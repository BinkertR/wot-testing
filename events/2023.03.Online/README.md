# WoT Testfest
Purpose: Gather implementation experience for Profiles,
and gather additional implementation experience for other deliverables.

**However:** There are many at-risk items still outstanding for the TD and Discovery deliverables,
and these need to be resolved by early May to resolve them prior to our PR transition for
these documents.  **The Testfest should gather as much testing experience as possible to
resolve at-risk items in these documents.**

TODO: Pointers to Instructions.  Please see data/input_2022.
