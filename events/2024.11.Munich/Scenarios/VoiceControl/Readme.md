# Voice Control Scenario

## Involved Devices and Applications

- Philips Hue
- KNX IoT Devices
- sayWoT! Gateway
- McCool 9000 (Consumer application that will talk to the other ones)

## Mashup Explanation

McCool 9000 gets voice input and understands the TDs, so that a mashup can be run that talks to all devices. 
sayWoT! gateway will be needed to proxy KNX IoT to HTTP since the McCool 9000 can only use HTTP devices.

## Results

### Worked
