# Efficient Energy Management in Buildings Scenario

## Involved Devices and Applications

- Siemens TargetV device with temperature, humidity and CO2 sensor (MQTT)
- KNX IoT Device with Thermostat
- Philips Hue simulating the status of a thermostat
- sayWoT! Gateway
- Event Processing Engine on the device
- TinyML Engine on the device
- Consumer apps should be provided by others

## Mashup Explanation
Update thermostat functionality dynamically at runtime by loading/unloading rules via Event Processing Engine and predicting person presence via TinyML Engine to save energy.
