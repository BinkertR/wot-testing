### Mashup Explanation  

In today’s interconnected business environment, organizations face complex challenges in managing supply chains and ensuring transparency. The EU’s circular economy roadmap and regulatory directives, such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP), emphasize standardized data access and traceability, particularly in sectors like batteries, textiles, and construction. By 2030, these requirements will expand across industries.  

At the 2024 Plugfest, Archeion will showcase a full-stack IoT solution for monitoring assets and tracking critical events on the blockchain, through three distinct scenarios:  

1. **Food Supply Chain**: Real-time tracking of temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels in storage and transport to ensure food safety and compliance.  
2. **Equipment as a Service (EaaS)**: Transparent monitoring of equipment usage and performance, enabling data-driven leasing models and sustainability reporting.  
3. **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain**: Precise environmental monitoring and traceability for sensitive pharmaceutical products to meet stringent quality standards.  

Key features demonstrated:  
- Integration of IoT sensors, edge computing, and Archeion’s hybrid cloud (Web3/Web2) platform.  
- Event generation based on IoT sensor data, selectively stored on a shared blockchain for secure, auditable records.  
- Web of Things for interoperability and scalability across diverse industries.  

This mashup highlights how Archeion’s solution bridges IoT and blockchain to address real-world challenges in transparency, traceability, and sustainability.
