# WoT At-Risk Assertion Resolution Meeting - March 2023

* Summarize new work on deliverables
* Review and explain at-risk items
* Gather implementation experience and resolve at-risk items

NOTE: this meeting is not about promoting WoT to newcomers, it is 
about gathering experience from existing implementers so we can retire
at-risk features.  So we probably we want a targetted invitation list,
and don't want to promote it on twitter, etc. 
(Changing name to capture this).

Invitations to:

* Presenters in CG meetings
* SDO collaborators, e.g. ECHONET
* Existing WG/IG members - implementation owners

SCOPE: it may not even be possible to cover all deliverables and assertions,
we will need to prioritize.  Only 1h long!
